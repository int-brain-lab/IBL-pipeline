Among many features, it offers a way to develop data pipelines with built-in integrity and consistency checks, and provides facility to define tables for computations with tools to quickly parallelize the processing over multiple computers! To learn more, please visit the website [DataJoint.io](https://datajoint.io). There you will find links to our interactive playgrounds and tutorials. \n",
