# Getting started with DataJoint for IBL #

1. Email austin@vathes.com for a database username.

2. Install Docker (https://www.docker.com/). Linux users also need to install Docker Compose separately. For Mac: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/.

3. Fork the repository (https://github.com/int-brain-lab/IBL-pipeline) onto your own GitHub account. If you do it via the GitHub web, the top of the GitHub page should now display 'YourGitHubAccount/IBL-pipeline (forked from int-brain-lab/IBL-pipeline'.

4. Clone the forked repository, i.e. copy the files to your local machine by typing in command terminal `git clone git@github.com:YourUserName/IBL-pipeline.git` .

5. Create a .env file in the cloned directory IBL-pipeline and **modify user and password values** per Step 1. To create an .env file, simply create a text file, and edit the extension .txt into .env. Copy in the following file content.

    File contents of ``.env``:
    ```
    DJ_HOST=datajoint.internationalbrainlab.org
    DJ_USER=username
    DJ_PASS=password
    ```

6. Copy your `.one_params` file into `IBL-pipeline/root` to not be prompted for Alyx login (see https://ibllib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02a_installation_python.html).

Note: if you first build the docker container and then add `.one_params`, running ONE() in Python may still prompt you for your Alyx and FlatIron login details. In this case, do
	```
	docker-compose down
	docker image rm ibl-pipeline_datajoint:latest
	docker-compose up -d
	docker exec -it ibl-pipeline_datajoint_1 /bin/bash
	```
!ToDo: clarify if step 6 is necessary when not importing ONE()
!ToDO Remove test GC

7. To save figures into AlyxPlots on the Google Drive, you can mount this path to somewhere inside the docker. The save the figs into the docker folder. The saved results will be automatically present in the outside folder you mounted.

	a. `docker-compose down`

	b. open `docker-compose.yml`

	c. add `~/Google Drive/Rig building WG/DataFigures/BehaviourData_Weekly/Snapshot_DataJoint/:/Snapshot_DataJoint_shortcut` in to the `volumes:`

	d. close the file

	e. `docker-compose up -d`

Then save the plots from Python into `/Snapshot_DataJoint_shortcut` inside the docker, then youâ€™ll see that the plots are in the folder you want.

## To run your own Python scripts ##

8. If you would like to enter the docker and run scripts through the terminal, navigate `cd` to the IBL-pipeline directory, `chmod +x ibl_docker_setup.sh` (only needed once, will give you permission to treat this file as an 'executable') will allow you to run 
```
./ibl_docker_setup.sh
```

Which contains the following individual steps (as well as starting Docker):

```
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it ibl-pipeline_datajoint_1 /bin/bash
```

After Docker has started, you'll be dropped in a new Terminal. To go back from there to the `IBL-pipeline/ibl_pipeline/analysis` folder containing Python scripts: `cd /src/ibl-pipeline/ibl_pipeline/analyses`.

Then run e.g. the behavioral snapshot code: `python behavioral_snapshot.py` or `python behavioral_overview_perlab.py`.

## To run example notebooks ##

9. Move into the cloned directory in a terminal, then run `docker-compose up -d`.

10. Go to http://localhost:8888/tree in your favorite browser to open Jupyter Notebook.

11. Open "Datajoint pipeline query tutorial.ipynb".

12. Run through the notebook and feel free to experiment.

# Instructions to ingest Alyx data into local database #

To run an local instance of database in the background, run the docker-compose command as follows:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up -d
```

This will create a docker container with a local database inside. To access the docker from the terminal, first get the docker container ID with `docker ps`, then run:

```bash
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
```

Now we are in the docker, and run the bash script for the ingestion:

```
bash /src/ibl-pipeline/scripts/ingest_alyx.sh ../data/alyx_dump/2018-10-30_alyxfull.json
```

Make sure that the json file is in the correct directory as shown above.

To turn stop the containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml down
```

# Instructions to ingest Alyx data into Amazon RDS

To insert Alyx data into the remote Amazon RDS, create a .env file in the same directory of your `docker-compose.yml`, as instructed in Step 4 above. 

Now run the docker-compose as follows, it will by default run through the file `docker-compose.yml`

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will create a docker container and link to the remote Amazon RDS. Then follow the same instruction of ingestion to the local database.
